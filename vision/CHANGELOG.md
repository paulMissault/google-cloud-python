  removed.

  release.

### Features

- The `v1p1beta1` endpoint has been added. (#4493)

  This is a superset of `v1` and includes features that are still in beta
  on the API side. You can opt in to this endpoint by importing it explicitly:

  ```python
  from google.cloud import vision_v1p1beta1
  client = vision_v1p1beta1.ImageAnnotatorClient()
  ```
